## Hi there ☁️ I'm Ved! 👋

☁️ Cloud enthusiast by day, caffeine-fueled keyboard warrior by night.  
☁️ I don't chase clouds; I deploy them.  
☁️ Sometimes I wonder if my code runs better when it rains.  
☁️ Security? Yep, I lock my code tighter than my front door.  
☁️ Building things that make life easier... or at least, less annoying.  
☁️ Favorite hobby? Spinning up servers and pretending they're sentient.  
☁️ Breaking things so I can fix them and call it "experience."  
☁️ 100% uptime? Working on it. 100% dedication? Already there.  
☁️ My Git commits may be messy, but my cloud architectures are clean.  
☁️ I speak fluent YAML... and sarcasm.

⚡ Fun fact: I still believe deleting `node_modules` is a personality trait.
